# OCalc

OCalc is an overengineered calculator that (currently) takes in arithmetic expressions and outputs assembly code for an imaginary stack machine.

## Usage
In a terminal, run `make` to compile the source code, followed by `./main` to run the program. To remove files generated by `make`, run `make clean`.

## Example
This little example shows all the operators supported by OCalc. (Comments after `#` were not generated by the program.)
